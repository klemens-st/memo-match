## How to play

### Installing

Clone this repository, either by going to the desired directory and running `git clone https://github.com/zymeth25/memo-match.git`
or by clicking the green "Clone or download" button on the [repository's main page](https://github.com/zymeth25/memo-match)
and downloading a ZIP. The second option is most probably the only one if you are on Windows.
When you have the files ready on your computer (unzipped, if necessary), open the `index.html` file. That's it!

If you are using a mobile device or just don't want to download anyting, you can
[go to this URL](https://zymeth25.github.io/memo-match/) and start the game right away.

### Gampeplay

Once you have launched the game, hit the "Start" button - a new deck of cards will appear. Then, just click or tap on the cards to flip
them over. When two cards are open the game will either lock them if their symbols match, or flip them back to closed position if it is
a mismatch. You can reset the game by hitting the `â†»` button above the deck.

### Rating

The game will also count the moves you make (2 flips = 1 move) and assign a star rating based on this number.
There is also a timer but it does not affect the actual score.

### Leaderboard

Once you have matched all cards, a modal will pop up. It will allow you to enter your name and save your score.
Note that the score is stored locally in your browser, not globally on a server.
To clear the leaderboard, tap/click the button below the table and hold it for 5 seconds. (The button will not appear
if the leaderboard is empty).
